# Rocket-Elevators-Golang-Controller
This is the template to use for the golang commercial controller. You will find the classes that should be used along with some methods described in the requirements. The necessary files to run some tests are also included. 

### Installation

With golang installed on your computer, all you need to do is initialize the module:

`go mod init Rocket-Elevators-Commercial-Controller`

The code to run the scenarios is included, and can be executed with:

`go run . <SCENARIO-NUMBER>`

To launch the tests:

`go test`

With a fully completed project, you should get an output like:

You can also get more details about each test by adding the `-v` flag: 

`go test -v` 

which should give something like:
